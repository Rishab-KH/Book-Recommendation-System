# Book Recommendation System
Used Kaggle Dataset to get recommended books using various models
Matrix Factorization that creates a pivot table between user and book interaction using rating then calculates similarity between books using cosine similarity. 
K Nearest Neighbors follow similar techniques as above but they group books into clusters using Nearest Neighbors and then based on cosine similarity suggests recommended books
Neural Network recommender system uses dot product between user embedding and then using multiple dense layers creates a model to recommend books to users 
KNN Recommender System gives the optimum results and has better readability
